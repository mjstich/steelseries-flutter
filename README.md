A port of the Steel Series Java gauges to Flutter.

## Features

Several fully animated highly configurable gauges and widgets.

## Getting started

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package.

## Usage

An initalization function should be invoked at the start of your application to create several images used to support several background rendering options.


```dart
initBuffers();
```

The gauges and widgets support a wide array of visualization options with default values for each supported option.  The user is free to provide only the overrides they want to differ from the default values.
